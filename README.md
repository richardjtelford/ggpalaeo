# ggpalaeo: diagnostic plots for rioja and analogue objects using ggplot2

Install with 

```
devtools::install_github("richardjtelford/ggpalaeo")
```

Has diagnostic plots for squared residual lengths, analogue distances, and transfer function measured/predicted plots. 
Make no attempt to make all sensible plots for all objects, just what I need now.
