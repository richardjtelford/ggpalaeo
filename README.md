This package includes diagnostic plots for squared residual lengths, analogue distances, and transfer function measured/predicted plots. 

It also has functions that augment `rioja::strat.plot()` by adding a second y-axis, radiocarbon dates into the left margin, and a summary diagram.

Make no attempt to make all sensible plots for all objects, just what I need now.
